# HW07: Text Adventure

Create a text adventure in which the player can move around the rooms and pick up / drop items. The player should be able to see the items in the room and list items in his/her inventory.

## UML

Here is a class diagram for the design:

## Strategy

Create a main file that contains the `main` function, in addition to the class files. In this `main` function, do this:

1. create room objects
2. link the rooms
3. create the player
4. put the player in the starting room
5. create items
6. put items in the rooms/player

Then the game loop should basically be: `while(p->handleInput())` where `p` is the player.

## Requirements

You must have at least:

- 10 rooms, each with a title and a description, and all rooms must be connected somehow
- 1 player
- 5 items, which can be picked up and dropped in rooms
