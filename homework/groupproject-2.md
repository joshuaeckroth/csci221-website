# Project Milestone 2

## Group 1: `hint`

Github repo: [https://github.com/StetsonMathCS/hint](https://github.com/StetsonMathCS/hint)

### Milestone 2

Milestone 2 is due Fri May 1, and the following eight tasks should be completed. There are eight members in the group, so each person should take one task. I'll let the group decide who takes what.

1. Create functions for creating/updating/deleting data in the data structures
2. Create code that opens editor on temp file allowing user to type their data
3. Create functions for printing data (in a nice format) from data structures
4. Connect main function to create/update/delete and printing functions
5. Save/load (serialize/deserialize) data structures to files on system and in user home directory
6. Integrate search feature with data structures
7. Integrate stackoverflow lookup (when data is added to data structure, search in data for URLs, and add stackoverflow answer to end of data)
8. Create Makefile, merge git branches so master branch contains a working program by the due date
